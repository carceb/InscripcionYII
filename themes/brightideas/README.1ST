README for Artisteer 3.0 -based Theme – “Bright Ideas”
Created: August 9, 2011

Requirements: 
-----------------
Artisteer requires a custom menu called ArtMenu.php provided in the theme zip file.  
Copy ArtMenu.php to your protected/components directory BEFORE using the theme.  

The contents of the zip file should be unzipped in your themes directory as usual.

Optional Configuration:
The header displayed on all themed pages includes an art-logo-name and art-logo-text (i.e. the subtitle).  By default, the theme will use the application name set in the protected/config/main.php file.  If the art-logo-name and art-logo-text parameters are set in the config file, these will be used.  Sample settings are provided below:
        'params'=>array(
                ...
                'art-logo-name'=>'BIG MONEY, INC.',
                'art-logo-text'=>'A Hand In Every Pocket',
        ),

OTHER: 
----------
The main and 1-column layout is provided. 

Also included is an index.php file in the ../views/site directory.  This displays a sample 
with examples of the various style settings when you first install the theme.  Most likely 
you'll want to rename this file and use your own index.php under the protected/views/site 
directory.  

Lastly, a index.html, home.html and other sample files are included in the css directory.  You can best understand how to use Artisteer markup by studying the 
provided layouts and page.html file.
